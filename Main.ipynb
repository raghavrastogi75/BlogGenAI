      " There is a segment of people who is a firm believer in intuition . But need we to understand when is it appropriate to decide rationally and when on intuition completely? Intuition works best when you have already made a decision on a similar thing earlier and are faced with another decision . When we are trying to decide based on consequences of our action, things like how would it affect my life if I go abroad, will my life improve eventually if I leave the current job, will it backfire, will I regret this decision, etc., we are only focused on one aspect and missing out another huge factor from this equation . We must rely on our rational capabilities to make a rational decision in these situations . The cost of inaction in many situations would be even more enticing despite the risks of taking a big risk . You are not asking everyone to take a ‘calculated one decision, but a 'Calculated one’ You are the best judge for it for it’s the best\n"
